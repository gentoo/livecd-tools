This list is split into two alphabetical lists. The first is a listing of the
authors of the original Gentoo package. The copyrights for all of those code
contributions belong to the Gentoo Foundation. The second list is the authors
whom have contributed significant code to the new project. All code added to
the new project is copyrighted by the respective authors.

The above paragraph was true until Dec 26, 2009. Then there was a period of
hiatus and on Feb 10, 2011 development was resumed inside Gentoo.
